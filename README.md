## 🔥 Key Findings & Insights
💡 Longer distances significantly increase delivery time: Avg. delivery time is 40% higher for orders traveling over 10km.
💡 High traffic zones cause major delays: Orders in high-density traffic areas take up to 35% longer.
💡 Order processing bottlenecks exist: The time difference between order taken & pickup varies drastically, suggesting inefficiencies in early-stage processing.
💡 Customer satisfaction depends on delivery efficiency: Delivery persons with higher ratings tend to have faster delivery times.

## 🎯 Recommendations & Business Impact
✔️ Reduce pickup delays: Improve order assignment & preparation times to lower order-to-pickup delays.
✔️ Optimize delivery routes: Prioritize low-traffic routes and introduce dynamic routing strategies.
✔️ Regular vehicle maintenance: Vehicles with poor ratings slow down deliveries by 25%—routine checks can help.
✔️ Increase workforce during festivals: Demand spikes by 15-20%—pre-plan staffing to meet customer expectations.

## 🛠️ Technology & Tools Used
✅ Excel: Pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting, Power Query
✅ Python (for preprocessing & analysis): Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
